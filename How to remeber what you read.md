# How to Remember Everything You Read

---

## 🎯 Introduction
- Reading ≠ Remembering  
- Two stages of learning:
  - **Consumption**: taking in information
  - **Digestion**: processing and encoding into memory
- Goal: Not to remember *everything*, but to remember what matters



---

## 🧠 Why Not Aim to Remember Everything?
- Example: Kim Peek (FG Syndrome, no corpus callosum)
- Superhuman memory but struggled with reasoning/problem-solving
- Key lesson: **Retention + Application > Raw Recall**



---

## ⚖️ Balance is Key
- Over-consuming without digestion = forgetting (mental vomiting)
- Studies: up to 90% of consumed info is forgotten
- Solution: **Balance consumption with digestion**

## 📚 The PACER System
Categories of information:
1. **Procedural**
2. **Analogous**
3. **Conceptual**
4. **Evidence**
5. **Reference**



---

## 🔧 Procedural Information
- "How to" knowledge (skills, techniques, coding, languages)
- Targeted process: **Practice immediately**
- Don’t delay → Apply as soon as possible



---

## 🔗 Analogous Information
- Relates to prior knowledge
- Targeted process: **Critique analogies**
  - How are they similar?
  - Where do they differ?
  - Can we improve the analogy?



---

## 🌐 Conceptual Information
- "What" knowledge: facts, theories, principles
- Targeted process: **Mapping**
  - Use nonlinear note-taking (mind maps)
  - Build networks of connected concepts



---

## 📊 Evidence Information
- Concrete details: stats, dates, cases
- Targeted process: **Store & Rehearse**
  - Collect in notes, second brain, or flashcards
  - Rehearse later through application



---

## 🗂 Reference Information
- Specific details: constants, names, definitions
- Targeted process: **Store & Rehearse**
  - Best tool: spaced repetition flashcards (e.g., Anki)
  - Focus on direct recall



---

## 🧩 Putting It All Together
- Identify info type during **consumption**
- Apply targeted process during **digestion**
- Keep stages balanced for maximum retention



---

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- Don’t chase total recall—focus on usable knowledge
- Balance reading with processing
- Use PACER to match info type with the right strategy
- Build long-term retention through practice, critique, mapping, and rehearsal



---

## 📬 Next Steps
- Apply PACER in your own study sessions
- Experiment with mapping, flashcards, and analogies
- Sign up for learning newsletters or communities to refine your process
